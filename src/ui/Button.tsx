 * The wash that goes over the part NOT done.

 * Painting the done part was tried twice and neither way was right: darker
 * and it reads as a stain across the button, lighter and the part you have
 * finished looks like the part you have not. Paling what is left works
 * because it leaves the done part as the button's own colour — the thing you
 * are working towards is the button simply being itself.
 *
 * Faintly stronger at the far end, so the boundary where you have got to is
 * the crispest edge in it and the distance ahead fades away from you.
 *
 * How far it goes is a theme's business, not this file's: the word lies
 * across both halves in one ink, so the wash can only be as strong as that
 * ink can survive, and which ink that is depends on which way round the
 * accent and its ink are.
