// The pose is the peek: ears and face, a hint of chest, two front paws hooked
// over an edge, everything below that edge cut off. It is the pose that needs
// furniture to sit on, which is what makes it placeable in an app that is
// mostly cards.
//
// Nothing here is a picture. A coat is a handful of colours and two blobs
// clipped to the silhouette; an expression is a choice of eyes and a mouth.
// So the eleventh expression costs a line, not a drawing.
//
// Every moving part comes out as its own <g> with an id and a pivot already
// set, because a mascot welded into one path can only ever fade in and out.

// One box, 120 wide and 108 tall, with the ground along the bottom edge.
//
// The box height is a drawing decision, not a container. Make it taller and
// the paws show their straight sides and read as two posts; crop it here and
// only the domes clear the edge, which is what a paw hooked over something
// actually looks like.

// The head is not a shape, it is a shape under load. She is lying with her
// chin on the carpet, and that is the whole reason she is wider than she is
// tall: the weight spreads the lower half. Lift the head and the spread comes
// out of it — narrower, taller, brow further from the floor.
//
// So `squash` is a parameter and not a drawing. 1 is fully down on the
// carpet, 0 is head raised clear of it. The floor line stays put at y=100
// whatever it is set to, because that is the one thing she is resting on.

// One structure everywhere: an iris field, a pupil that fills most of it, and
// two highlights. The gaze moves the pupil and its highlights together, which
// is all "looking up and to the left" has ever been.

// One curve does both jobs.
//
// The eye closes because a lid comes down across it, so there is exactly one
// piece of geometry involved: the lid's edge. The mask is the region below
// that edge, and the drawn border IS that edge. Deriving them separately is
// what was broken before — the mask was a rectangle, so the top of the
// clipped eye was a straight horizontal line, while the border was a curved
// arc sliding down independently. Two different shapes; they could never
// agree, and what you saw was a line drifting over an eye that ignored it.
//
// t is how shut she is. 0 is open, and the lid then traces the top of the
// eye, which is why the border at rest looks like the eye's own outline. 0.5
// puts it flat across the middle. 1 bulges it past the bottom, which leaves
// no eye at all.
// Zero: at rest the lid sits exactly on the top of the eye, so the eye is a
// full circle and the border traces its outline. Any resting value above zero
// makes every eye a lens instead — a small distortion, applied permanently,
// to a shape that carries most of her character.
