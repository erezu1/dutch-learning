// A 200KB WASM player for one cat would also have baked her colours into the

// seven schemes in two ramps.
//
// The split that makes it work:
//
//   continuous  tilt, squash, ear turn, gaze. Numbers. They live in custom
//               properties, CSS transitions them, and two moods can therefore
//               be halfway between each other.
//   discrete    which eyes, which mouth, which brows. Drawings. All rendered
//               once and all but one hidden, so switching is an attribute
//               rather than a re-render — a fresh SVG would restart the breath
//               and drop every scheduled beat of the idle loop.

//
// SAD is not for a wrong answer. Making a cat look hurt when you miss a Dutch
// word is how an app becomes something you avoid opening, and the miss is
// already on the card — she does not need to score it too. It is for coming

// not about you.
//
// ANGRY is not for anything the app does. It is earned by pestering her: poke
// her four times inside a few seconds and she has had enough. That makes it
// the one mood the user can actually cause, which is worth more than using it
// as punishment, and it is self-limiting — stop poking and it never appears.

// Three rules from how this is done properly, all of which change the code:
//
// 1. The blink must NOT run on the same clock as the breath. Two loops of
//    fixed length, however well chosen, resolve into one long pattern and the
//    whole thing reads as a machine. So the breath is a CSS loop and every
//    other beat is scheduled on its own random interval.
// 2. One base loop goes stale after roughly a minute and a half. It needs
//    secondary idles — the ear flick, the nose twitch, the glance — fired far
//    enough apart that you never learn their rhythm.
// 3. Parts cascade rather than moving together. An ear that twitches at the
//    same instant as the head reads as one rigid object.
//
// Everything is driven through registered custom properties, so it composes
// with whatever pose the mood has set instead of overwriting it.
