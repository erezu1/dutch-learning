// On her back: the half turn onto her crown, the things she does while she is
// down there, and the half turn back.
//
// This is the one move the rest of the rig cannot express. Every other pose is
// a set of numbers handed to CSS, and CSS walks her there — but a half turn
// about her middle takes the flat of her head from her chin to her crown, her
// paws round the outside of her head rather than through the floor, and the
// light on her the other way from the turn. None of that is a channel. So for
// as long as she is over, one frame loop drives the parts directly, and when
// she is back up it hands every one of them back exactly as it found them.
//
// One number, p, runs from 0 (upright) to 1 (on her back), and everything is a
// function of it plus the clock — so the move can be played either way, and a
// reaction laid over the top of it composes with wherever the turn has got to.
