// Dutch speech. A recording first, the phone's own voice if there isn't one.
//
// The phone's text-to-speech is whatever the phone happens to have, and on
// Android that is often flat and robotic. So every word and sentence in the
// deck is recorded in advance, in each of a few voices (scripts/make-audio.py,
// with Piper: open source, made on a computer, no service behind it), and
// shipped as audio/<voice>/<hash>.ogg, named by a hash of its text so no index
// has to be downloaded to find it. A text with no recording — one added since
// the last recording, or any clip while offline and not yet heard — is spoken
// by the phone as before, and so is everything if the phone is the voice
// chosen.
//
// About the phone's voice:
// One thing to know before reading any of this: an empty voice list does not
// mean a silent phone. Android hands `getVoices()` back empty for the first
// seconds, and on plenty of devices until something has actually been spoken —
// while `speak()` with `lang = 'nl-NL'` goes straight to the system engine and
// talks anyway. So the list is evidence of a voice when it has one, and
// evidence of nothing at all when it doesn't.
